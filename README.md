Purpose: examine characteristics of customers who accepted the coupons and compare with the characteristics of customers who did not accept the coupons.

Findings:
While the overal coupon acceptance rate was slightly over half at 56%, differences in acceptance rate are stark depending on the venue offering the coupon.
Overall, "Carry out & Take away" coupons have the highest acceptance rate, followed closely by cheap restaurants under $20. More expensive restaurants and bars have the lowest acceptance rates.

Influential factors:
Passengers: For all venues except expensive restaurants, coupon accepters were most likely to have friends as their passengers in the car. Those who accepted the expensive restaurant coupons were most likely to
have their partner in the car.
Income: Unsurprisingly, those with higher income levels were much mroe likely to accept bar and expensive restaurant coupons than those with lower income ranges. For other venues, income doesn't matter as much.
Time of day: A big factor in coupon acceptance rates, especially for cheap restaurants. Coupons to cheap restaurants were most likely to be accepted in the evening or late afternoon, coupons to bars were most 
likely to be accepted at night, and coupons to coffee houses were most likely to be accepted in the morning. However, it is interesting that coupons to expensive restaurants were most likely to be accepted at
10AM, perhaps because that is the time when the biggest deals are available.
Weather: For most venues, coupons are most likely to be accepted on sunny days. An interesting exception is coffee houses, where coupons are most likely to be accepted on rainy days, followed closely by sunny days.
Those who received coupons on snowy and rainy days tended to have some of the lowest acceptance rates.
Occupation: Unemployed and retired people had the lowest acceptance rates of the expensive restaurant coupons.

Strategies for each venue offering coupons:
Target repeat customers of similar venues. People who frequent bars are much more likely to accept bar coupons than those who do not.
Offer coupons expiring in 1 day rather than in 2 hours. This was persistently a top attribute of coupon accepters for all venues.

Bar:
Target those who frequent expensive restaurants as well as bars. Those have some of the highest acceptance rates.
Target singles.

Coffee House:
Target healthcare workers, students, and those who work in the transportation/moving industry.
Timing matters. Those who received coupons at 10AM had some of the highest acceptance rates.

Carry out/Take away: 
Timing matters. 2PM and 6PM have the highest acceptance rates.
Target those in the food preparation and serving related industry, as well as those in the business and financial industries.
Target those on their way home.

Restaurants (<$20):
Timing matters. Target customers in the afternoon around 2PM and 6PM, as those times had the highest acceptance rates.
Target those who have occupations related to sales.
Offer coupons on sunny, warm days, as those factors have some of the biggest correlation with acceptance rates.

Restaurants:
Timing matters. 10 AM is the time with the highest coupon acceptance rate.
Target those who are in a relationship with a partner.
